Extended UI to add for easily changeable settings.

Just add the new UI as a new Node in your scene.

The "Hover Style" animations are referring to your applied theme in Godot.

To use a FancyTooltip - add it as a child of the node you want to show the tooltip for. (Either FancyButton or FancyLabel)

UI Added
- FancyButton (Button)
- FancyLabel (RichTextLabel)
- FancyTooltip (Panel)

Known Issues

- Typewriter Animation not working on Tooltip Labels
- Typewriter Animation not working on Update for FancyLabels
